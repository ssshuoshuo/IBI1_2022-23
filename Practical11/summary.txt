In this analysis, we compared the ACE2 protein sequences of three species: 
cat, mouse, and human. We calculated the alignment score and the 
percentage of identical amino acids for each pairwise comparison. The 
results are as follows:

Cat and Human:
Alignment Score: 3717
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 85%
Cat and Mouse:
Alignment Score: 3592
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 82%
Human and Mouse:
Alignment Score: 3579
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 82%
Based on the alignment scores and the percentage of identical amino acids, 
we can observe that the ACE2 protein sequences of cat and human show the 
highest similarity, indicating that they are the most closely related. 
This suggests a closer evolutionary relationship between the ACE2 proteins 
in cats and humans.

From an evolutionary perspective, we can infer that the ACE2 gene in mice 
diverged earlier from the common ancestor of cats and humans. Over time, 
the ACE2 genes in humans and cats followed separate evolutionary paths, 
leading to some differences in their sequences.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on a single protein 
and the similarity observed may not perfectly reflect the true 
evolutionary distance. Other factors and proteins should be considered to 
gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary relationships among 
these species.

Overall, these findings provide insights into the evolutionary 
relationships of ACE2 proteins among cat, mouse, and human, highlighting 
the closer proximity between cats and humans in terms of ACE2 sequence 
similarity.
