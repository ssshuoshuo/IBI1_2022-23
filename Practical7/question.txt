Questionï¼š How have new cases and total deaths developed over time in 
China?

line 104 to line 130

I expect that the total cases and total deaths will increase smoothly at 
the beginning,
and rise exponentially in the middle and get stable in the end.

The figure showed me that after the initial development in the first 
month, 
the number of infected people grew and increased exponentially in 
February, 
and got stable in March.

The larger the infected base, the more people will be infected. So 
exponential growth makes sense. 
The low number of deaths may be caused by medical control or the low 
fatality rate of the virus. 
But actually, the period of rising exponentially should be longer because 
of the large population of China. 
I infer that the short period of exponentially rising may be the result of 
China's effective epidemic prevention policy.
